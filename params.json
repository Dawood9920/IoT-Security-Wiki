{"name":"IoT Security Wiki","tagline":"One Stop for IoT Security Resources","body":"### Welcome to IoT Security Wiki Website.\r\n\r\nSo this website is an intiative to help developers and security researchers to get all security resource related to IoT Security. Although listing out all resources related to IoT is very difficult, but i have tried my best to list out Major technical material available. \r\n\r\nAs  IoT is broadly based on four components: Embedded Systems, Cloud, Network, Mobile. We will have resource related to first three in this wiki and for Mobile we already have [MobileSecurityWiki](https://mobilesecuritywiki.com) which is also my project.\r\n\r\nIf you find anything missing or have some resource to add, please add through [contribute](#contribute) section.\r\n\r\nFollow IoT Security Wiki on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/IoTSecurityWiki) to get latest updates about IoT Security\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n##Presentations \r\n\r\n| Presentation                                                                             | Conference     | Year | Author                            | Link                                                                                                                                                                                           |\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| A Surface Area Approach to Pen-testing the IoT                                           | Defcon 23      | 2015 | Daniel Miessler                   | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhxHHD790nw) [Slide](https://www.iotvillage.org/slides_DC23/IoT-Attack-Surfaces-DEFCON-2015-2.pdf)                                                     |\r\n| The Hand that Rocks the Cradle: Hacking IoT Baby Monitors                                | Defcon23       | 2015 | Mark Stanislav                    | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QU6OVkMg68)                                                                                                                                           |\r\n| Security of Wireless Home Automation Systems -
